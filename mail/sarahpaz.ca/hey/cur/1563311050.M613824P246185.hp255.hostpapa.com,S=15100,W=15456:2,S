Al S (2019-07-16 18:24:28 UTC)
Hello Sarah Paz. How can I help?

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:25:15 UTC)
Hello! I'm trying to make a spelling change on an order I just made, but =
when I try to save it I get an error.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:25:25 UTC)
Order NUmber: #0462640170

Al S (2019-07-16 18:26:08 UTC)
I can certainly reprocess this order for you, free of charge and make any=
 changes you would like on my end.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:26:38 UTC)
I'm trying one more time to see if I can make the change..

Al S (2019-07-16 18:27:20 UTC)
I don't believe you will be able to. It looks like the order has already =
entered into production.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:27:26 UTC)
Okay, yeah I can't. I get a yellow message with an error and it does't sa=
ve the changes.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:27:37 UTC)
It says I have 30 mins to make edits

Al S (2019-07-16 18:27:51 UTC)
I can make the changes for you on my end.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:28:28 UTC)
Great!

Al S (2019-07-16 18:28:34 UTC)
Sometimes when you choose the faster shipping options you won't have quit=
e as much time to edit the order. I apologize about that.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:28:39 UTC)
I just want to make one little change to one word on the front design

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:28:54 UTC)
I have TRAVELER

Al S (2019-07-16 18:28:55 UTC)
I can do that for you.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:28:59 UTC)
can we change it to TRAVELLER

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:29:10 UTC)
with 2 L's

Al S (2019-07-16 18:29:15 UTC)
Yes, I can do that for you right now.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:29:24 UTC)
Thank you so much!

Al S (2019-07-16 18:29:42 UTC)
And that is the only change you would like made?

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:30:08 UTC)
Yes! Just wanted to change it from the US spelling to Canadian spelling s=
ince I'm Canada based. :)

Al S (2019-07-16 18:30:28 UTC)

That will show the change.

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:31:21 UTC)
Perfect! Thank you so much for your help. :)

Al S (2019-07-16 18:31:38 UTC)

Sarah Paz (2019-07-16 18:31:50 UTC)
