Hi Sarah,  
  
Thank you for applying to Hatchways on Indeed for a Junior Web Developer
position. We use our platform to find and hire talent for our company- the
next step in our process is to complete an online assessment based on your
skillset.  
  
The big bonus is that while you are completing your online assessment for
Hatchways, it enables you opportunities not only for employment at Hatchways,
but potential employment opportunities with the tech startups we work with in
Toronto. In other words, by completing one assessment, you gain accessibility
to dozens of other start-ups.  
  
You can find the next step here: <https://hatchways.io/#/candidates/signup>  
  
We host interview cycles every month for internship and full-time
opportunities that can start right away. We take candidates with any
background. If you are accepted into an interview round, you don't need to
apply to any of the startups, we automatically set up interviews for you. Our
next interview cycle is June 24th, and candidates must complete their online
assessment by June 15th to qualify.  
  
There is a lot more information on our website, but if you have any questions
I'd be happy to chat further. Let me know if this is interesting to you at
all.  
  
Thanks!  
Jaclyn![](http://infinite-stream-5194.herokuapp.com/pixel/mmm_nJ1nJM.gif)
