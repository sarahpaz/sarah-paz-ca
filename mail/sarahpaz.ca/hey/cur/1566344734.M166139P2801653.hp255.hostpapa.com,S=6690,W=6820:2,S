Hey heysarahpaz,

One of my team members just sent me your Instagram profile after coming 
across your account because we both follow Shopify.

I wanted to quickly introduce myself. My name is Chase and I run Boundless 
Labs where we specialize in email marketing.

We currently work with and consult for a ton of brands that use Shopify 
such as The Chivery, Manhattan Beachwear, Original Grain, and many others 
(and they're all awesome)!

I'd love to connect with you or someone on your team if you're looking to 
improve your email channel. Most of our clients are doing anywhere from 
about 25%-35% of their total revenue from email.

Thanks,
Chase

P.S. Here is my LinkedIn profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasedimond/> for your 
reference - I'd love to connect there as well.
