Hi Connor,

I hope all is well, and that you are enjoying your long weekend! I=E2=80=99=
m sorry
for the late notice on this, I actually thought I sent an email last week
but I guess it never went through. I was hoping you could share a breakdown
of what to expect on my onsite interview on Tuesday September 3rd, for the
Implementation Specialist role. I am very interested in the role, and would
love to be able to prepare as best as I could so any details you can share
would be much appreciated. I see that I will be meeting with quite a few
people, and just wanted to ensure I am well prepared for anything that
comes my way.

If this finds you too late, no worries! I thought I=E2=80=99d reach out jus=
t in
case.

Thank you, and I look forward to meeting with you on Tuesday!

Best,
Sarah Paz
