Hello Sarah,=20

My name is Celeste and I am a community manager at EdPresso =
<https://www.educative.io/edpresso> by Educative. I am reaching out to =
you because, as a full stack web dev student, I think that you would be =
a great addition to our developer-author community. Educative is a =
website that provides interactive courses for developers by developers, =
and EdPresso is its shortened version.  We only allow articles that =
would take about 3-4 minutes to read, to be published, which means that =
this would not take up too much of your time. This opportunity is =
unpaid, but you are given visible credit for every article you write and =
can provide information about yourself as well as links to your social =
media/webpage. Although this is not a formal internship, it is a great =
thing to put on your resume and an excellent way to gain recognition =
within the tech community. In fact, our shot on reversing strings in =
Python is Google=E2=80=99s featured article when that term is searched! =
I have attached our info page here =
<https://www.educative.io/m/educativeio-edpresso-write-with-us> for you =
to take a look at. If you are interested in this opportunity or would =
like to find out more, shoot me a message!

Cheers,
Celeste
