Hi Emmy,

Good morning and happy Wednesday! I just wanted to send a follow-up =
email in regards to the onsite interview I had yesterday for the =
Implementation Specialist role in Toronto. As well, I wanted to thank =
you for taking the time to share with me a few focuses for the =
interview, it was very helpful. I really enjoyed meeting with the team, =
learning a deeper understanding of the role, as well as the company =
culture and growth. Instacart definitely strikes me as a company who =
really supports the growth and development of their employees, and this =
is something that is very important to me as well. I would love to =
connect to further discuss any feedback about my interview, and =
potential next steps.=20

If you have any questions, please reach out.

Looking forward to chatting soon.

Best Regards,
Sarah Paz
