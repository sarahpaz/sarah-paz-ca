Hi Connor,

Happy Thursday, I hope all is well! I just wanted to reach out and =
follow-up on the onsite interview I had on Tuesday September 3rd for the =
Implementation Specialist role. In your last reply you suggested I call =
Emmy, but I sent her an email instead as I didn=E2=80=99t have her =
number. I have yet to receive a reply, and was curious if there=E2=80=99s =
a better way for me to be in touch with her, or if you possibly have any =
feedback/updates you can share with me?=20

Thanks again - I look forward to your reply.

Best,
Sarah Paz
