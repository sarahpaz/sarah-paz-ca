Hello!

Thank you for you reply, below are my responses to the questions =
you=E2=80=99ve provided. If you have any further questions for me, =
please reach out.=20

Looking forward to your reply.

Best Regards,
Sarah Paz

=E2=80=A2 1) How good are you at managing website projects without or =
with little supervision?
b) Good. Need little supervision - can take care of most of the aspects =
of a website.


=E2=80=A2 2) How good are you with things like hosting, domain-setup, =
DNS, CDN, cPanel (or similar), WHM (or similar)?
b) Good. Some guidance needed.


=E2=80=A2 3) How good are you with Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign?
b) Not an expert but can manage to complete basic tasks or can use =
research / tad bit of guidance to do what needs to be done.


=E2=80=A2 4) How good are you with CSS, JS, HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery?
b) Proficient.


=E2=80=A2 5) How good are you with Wordpress and readymade Themes?
b) Good. Need some guidance / supervision.


=E2=80=A2 6) How good are you with integrating APIs?
b) Good. Some guidance needed.


=E2=80=A2 7) Have good are you with things like SEO, SEM, Schema (and =
likes), Social platforms, Site Optimization?
b) Good. Some supervision / guidance needed.


=E2=80=A2 8) What is the most complex (website-related) task you have =
single-handedly addressed? Please describe the problem and how resolved =
it.
The most complex website-related tasks I=E2=80=99ve single-handedly =
addressed probably would have been in the start of my career working =
with site experience and front-end development. I started to work on =
these kinds of projects before studying Full Stack Web Development, so a =
lot of this work was me jumping in to help and learning front-end on the =
side (online courses, college certificate program etc.). The challenge =
for me with this was cross browser testing and responsive designs. I =
have since learned how to resolve these issues and provide a seamless =
experience across various browsers and devices. With that being said, I =
am always learning new ways to continue to improve the overall user =
experience.


=E2=80=A2 9) Do you consider yourself a flexible person who can easily =
go with the flow of changing priorities?
I definitely do! I think I've gained this skill being exposed to =
start-up companies. Having to work outside of my job description, adapt =
to changes in company initiatives, and come up with quick and scrappy =
solutions when needed.=20


=E2=80=A2 10) Occasionally we have periods where quite a bit of work =
needs to be done in a short time. This leads to longer days. Can you =
describe your expectations around working hours and how you see your =
commitment to your responsibilities?
I=E2=80=99m very focused on achieving goals and getting the job done. I =
understand this sometimes exceeds working hours, but I=E2=80=99m not one =
to focus on the clock, and more so focused on the goal. If something =
needs to be done, I have no problem working to ensure the project is =
complete and the client is more than satisfied with the results.


=E2=80=A2 11) The responsibilities that encompass an average day in our =
organization can be quite diverse. Are you a person that is willing to =
roll up your sleeves and pitch in despite the tasks sometimes falling =
outside of your typical role?
I definitely am! I have worked for various start-ups and I thrive in =
this kind of environment. I like the challenge, and to be able to learn =
new skills on the job. A lot of the roles I=E2=80=99ve worked started =
off one way and transformed into something else because of ability to =
adapt to company needs.=20


=E2=80=A2 12) What three things do you bring to the table?
My web development skills, ability to learn quickly and pick up new =
skills fast, and I=E2=80=99m also great at working independently with =
little supervision as I=E2=80=99ve worked remotely for the past 3 years.=20=



=E2=80=A2 13) Please describe your salary expectations.
$60,000 - $65,000


=E2=80=A2 14) If selected, when could you start?
I can start asap.=20
