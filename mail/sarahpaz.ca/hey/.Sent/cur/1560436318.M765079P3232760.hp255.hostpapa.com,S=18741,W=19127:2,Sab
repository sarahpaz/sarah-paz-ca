comfortable office set up at home to ensure productivity.=20

> 2. Are you currently employed? if yes, what's your current position?
Yes, I am employed remote full-time. My position is Merchandising =
Specialist.=20

> 3. Are you willing to work flexible or long hours?
Yes, I am willing to work flexible or long hours. I do not work =
Thursdays so I am able to put in more hours on that day as needed. I am =
happy to work later in the evening if needed, or earlier in the day as =
well.

> 4. Why do you feel you can greatly perform the roles of a "Remote =

know how to deal professionally with customers/clients. I also have 3 =
years of remote experience, I have a professional office set up with a =
strong internet connection, and am able to work productively from home.=20=


> 5. How would you describe your work ethics?
I am very dependable, responsible, and self-motivated. I do what is =

pretty comfortable with it.=20

> 7. What are your strengths and weakness and how does it affect your =
job performance?

organized, professional, and responsible, and work great independently =
as well as with a team. My willingness to support other teams can also =
be seen as a weakness, as I sometimes take on more than I can handle. =
With that being said, I am always flexible to work more hours if needed =
