Hi Connor,

I hope all is well, and that you are enjoying your long weekend! I=E2=80=99=
m sorry for the late notice on this, I actually thought I sent an email =
last week but I guess it never went through. I was hoping you could =
share a breakdown of what to expect on my onsite interview on Tuesday =
September 3rd, for the Implementation Specialist role. I am very =
interested in the role, and would love to be able to prepare as best as =
I could so any details you can share would be much appreciated. I see =
that I will be meeting with quite a few people, and just wanted to =
ensure I am well prepared for anything that comes my way.

If this finds you too late, no worries! I thought I=E2=80=99d reach out =
just in case.=20

Thank you, and I look forward to meeting with you on Tuesday!

Best,
Sarah Paz=
