Hi Emmy!

I have completed the technical assessment on HackerRank, but was only =
able to complete level 1 of the 2 part assessment. I understood the =
problem and the goal to achieve, but didn=E2=80=99t have SQLite or =
Postgres on my laptop and wasn=E2=80=99t able to write queries. I did =
attempt to download SQLite, but came across some issues so I had to =
think quick and decided to manually sort data as time was running out =
and I didn=E2=80=99t want to have an empty submission.

I really hope you will take my efforts and technical understanding of =
the problem at hand and the logic required to resolve the problem in =
consideration. I am very interested in this role, and I know I have a =
lot to bring to the team. With over 5 years experience in e-commerce, =
10+ in retail / customer service, and my current education in full stack =
web development I believe I would be a perfect fit and asset to the =
engineering team at Instacart. If given the opportunity to meet for an =
in-person interview I=E2=80=99m sure the team will see my passion for =
problem solving, my drive for ongoing growth and development, and my =
eagerness to improve the user experience both on the customers end and =
the retailers.=20

Please reach out if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Sarah=20
